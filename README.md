##  How It Works

This script uses the [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) environment to:

1. Randomly generate math questions
2. Create a new **sheet** with questions and answers
3. Generate a **Google Form** linked to that sheet
4. Export printable **PDFs** for both student and teacher
5. Auto-mark responses and sync to Sheets
